/// 
///Using Multiple Classes

///You can also create an object of a class
///and access it in another class. 
/// This is often used for better organization of classes
/// (one class has all the attributes and methods, while 
/// the other class holds the main() method (code to be executed)). 


public class Main {
    int x =5;
    String main = "Hello World";
