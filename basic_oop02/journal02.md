#### 📚 What I Learned
**New Concepts:**

**This is how to run java program w packages**
-   1. Compile (from inside basic_oop folder)
        javac *.java

-   2. Go to parent directory
        cd ..

-   3. Run with package name
        java basic_oop.LocationTester

    *( Why this is necessary:
    Package declaration: package basic_oop; tells Java this class belongs to the basic_oop package
    Java expects: The package structure to match the directory structure
    From parent directory: Java can find LocationTester.class)*

**Code Examples:**
```java
